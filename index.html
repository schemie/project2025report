                        The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
                        should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other
                        agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.

                        Scientific agencies like NOAA* are vulnerable to obstructionism of an Administration’s aims if
                        political appointees are not wholly in sync with Administration policy. Particular attention
                        must be paid to appointments in this area.
